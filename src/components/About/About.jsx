            <h2>Cause of The Recent Flood</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Effects of Climate Change:</strong> The monsoon season in
              South Asia has grown more severe and prolonged in recent years.
              Nepal has seen a significant increase in both the volume and
              intensity of rain. Between Thursday and Saturday, Kathmandu
              received 322 mm of rain, with 240 mm falling in just one day, a
              record over two decades. The extended monsoon and unprecedented
              rains have caused widespread flooding and destruction.

          <h2>Purpose of Fundraising</h2>
          <p>
            Our fundraising efforts focus on providing immediate relief for the
            most basic needs. Donations will primarily go towards food, clean
            water, emergency shelter, and medical supplies. As we assess the
            full scope of the damage, future efforts will expand to rebuilding
            homes and infrastructure, ensuring long-term recovery for affected
            communities.
